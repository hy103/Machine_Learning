## About MLOps

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is the practice of combining machine learning with DevOps principles to automate and streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This repository serves as a central hub for MLOps-related projects, tools, and resources.

## Projects

### 1. **Model Deployment Pipeline**

   - **Description:** A pipeline for deploying machine learning models into production.
   - **Technologies:** Kubernetes, Docker, Flask, FastAPI, AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or similar technologies.
   - **Benefits:** Accelerates the deployment of models, ensures scalability, and automates monitoring.

### 2. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for ML**

   - **Description:** Implement CI/CD pipelines for ML projects, including automated testing, building, and deployment.
   - **Technologies:** GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or similar.
   - **Benefits:** Ensures code quality, reproducibility, and automates deployment workflows.

### 3. **Model Monitoring and Drift Detection**

   - **Description:** Tools and scripts to monitor model performance and detect concept drift.
   - **Technologies:** Prometheus, Grafana, MLflow, Seldon Alibi-detect, or custom solutions.
   - **Benefits:** Ensures model reliability and early detection of data drift.

### 4. **Automated Data Pipelines**

   - **Description:** Build data pipelines for data collection, preprocessing, and transformation.
   - **Technologies:** Apache Airflow, Prefect, or custom solutions.
   - **Benefits:** Streamlines data ingestion and preprocessing.

### 5. **Explainable AI (XAI) Toolkit**

   - **Description:** Develop an XAI toolkit for model interpretability and transparency.
   - **Technologies:** LIME, SHAP, InterpretML, or custom interpretable models.
   - **Benefits:** Improves model understanding and trust.
